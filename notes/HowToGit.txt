Make a git account at github.com
clone my repository (I'll invite you after you make an account)

git@github.com:tjyahl/TAMU_REU_21.git


When you're ready to work:
go to your directory in a terminal
type "git status" (w/o quotes)
type "git pull" (this is very important)
work on stuff
type "git add BLAH" where BLAH is any file you've worked on
(you might have to git add BLAH a bunch if you have worked on multiple files)
type "git commit -m "HERE IS WHAT I DID"" (here the inside quotes DO appear, and HERE IS WHAT I DID should be replaced by a summary of what you've changed in the files [short though plx])
type "git push"
