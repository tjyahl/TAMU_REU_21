On The K4 crystal Sunada Slides

This might be good to look at for the graph theory intro as this was written 
for both non math people and math people:
Sunada Topolgical Crystallography: https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=CE4E2D17E2FD1CCAAF2C8803BBAFA992

Periodic operators:

Introduction to Quantum Graphs https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=4684163BAC1CFD56B5316CAA4C049890
- from this read the first few pages (1-3) and chapter 4.
