--An ongoing list of medium problems to examine for understanding.

-----------------
----Problem 1----
-----------------
--Consider the system 'F' below.
----a) Determine the number of solutions to 'F' using 'solveSystem'.
----
----b) Draw the support for each polynomial in 'F'.
----
----c) Show that the Galois group is the symmetric group S_3.

R = CC[x,y]
F = {1+2*x+3*y+5*x*y+7*y^2,1-3*x+7*y-13*x*y}

A = {}--write the supports here as matrices separated by a comma
M = sparseMonodromy(A,Solver=>M2)
monodromyLoop(M,30)
printCycleTally M



-----------------
----Problem 2----
-----------------
--Consider the new polynomial system 'G' obtained by replacing 'x' by 'x^2' in 'F'.
----a) Show that 'G' has twice as many solutions as 'F' (why is this?)
----
----b) Draw the supports for 'G', how do they differ from the supports of 'F'?
----
----c) Show that the Galois group is the wreath product (S_3 wr S_2) (that is, 3 blocks with 2 elements).
G = apply(F,f->sub(f,x=>x^2))

B = {}--enter new supports here
N = sparseMonodromy(B,Solver=>M2)
monodromyLoop(N,30)
printCycleTally N
